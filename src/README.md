# Code for IJCAI 2021 Paper Data Driven Methods for Balancing Fairness and Efficiency in Ride-Pooling

The code to re-create the plots is available here.   
To run the simulation, run "python main.py"   
The environment parameters are in model_settings.txt, and so changing these will change the environment parameters.    
The results will be in a pickle file with information from each epoch.
